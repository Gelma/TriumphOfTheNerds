1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:03,057
The story so far...

2
00:00:03,257 --> 00:00:07,112
In 1975, Ed Roberts invented the Altair 
personal computer.

3
00:00:07,644 --> 00:00:11,167
It was a pain to use until 19 year-old 
pre-billionaire Bill Gates

4
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:13,427
wrote the first personal computer language.

5
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:15,621
Still, the public didn't care.

6
00:00:15,953 --> 00:00:19,277
Then two young hackers, 
Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak,

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,135
built the Apple computer 
to impress their friends.

8
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:25,592
We were all impressed and Apple was 
a stunning success.

9
00:00:26,124 --> 00:00:29,846
By 1980, the PC market was worth 
a billion dollars.

10
00:00:30,245 --> 00:00:31,907
Now, view on...

11
00:01:00,823 --> 00:01:02,352
We are nerds.

12
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:06,341
Most of the people in the industry were young

13
00:01:06,341 --> 00:01:09,797
because the guys who had any real experience
were too smart

14
00:01:09,797 --> 00:01:11,659
to get involved in all these crazy little 
machines.

15
00:01:13,453 --> 00:01:16,844
It really wasn't that we were going to build 
billion dollar businesses.

16
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,372
We were having a good time.

17
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:21,763
I thought this was the most fun you 
could possibly have

18
00:01:21,763 --> 00:01:22,760
with your clothes on.

19
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:26,150
When the personal computer was invented 
more than twenty years ago

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,543
it was just that - an invention

21
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,205
it wasn't a business.

22
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:32,797
These were hobbyists who built these machines

23
00:01:32,864 --> 00:01:37,650
and wrote this software to have fun 
but that has really changed

24
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:42,635
and now this is a business,
 this is a big business.

25
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,508
How the personal computer industry grew

26
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:07,497
from zero to 100 million units is 
an amazing story.

27
00:02:08,228 --> 00:02:11,485
And it wasn't just those early funky companies
of nerds and hackers,

28
00:02:11,485 --> 00:02:13,745
like Apple, that made it happen.

29
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,471
Most of these transformation from hobby 
to big business

30
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:20,393
can be linked to three letters: IBM.

31
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:27,040
IBM was, and is, an American 
business phenomenon.

32
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:30,896
Over 60 years, Tom Watson and his son, 
Tom Jr., built 

33
00:02:30,896 --> 00:02:35,216
what their workers called Big Blue into the top 
computer company in the world.

34
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:38,474
But IBM made mainframe computers for 
large companies,

35
00:02:38,474 --> 00:02:39,803
not personal computers,

36
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:40,933
at least not yet.

37
00:02:41,399 --> 00:02:44,190
For the PC to be taken seriously by big business,

38
00:02:44,257 --> 00:02:47,913
the nerds of Silicon Valley had to meet 
the suits of corporate America.

39
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,491
IBM never fired anyone, requiring only

40
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,014
the undying loyalty to the company and a strict 
dress code.

41
00:03:01,008 --> 00:03:04,199
IBM hired conservative hard-workers 
straight from school.

42
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,190
Few IBM'ers were at the summer of love.

43
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:13,771
Their turn-ons were giant mainframes and 
corporate responsibility.

44
00:03:15,234 --> 00:03:18,624
They worked nine to five and on Saturdays
washed the car.

45
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:32,318
This is intergalactic HQ for IBM,

46
00:03:32,451 --> 00:03:34,312
the largest computer company in the world...

47
00:03:34,312 --> 00:03:38,167
but in many ways IBM is really more a country 
than it is a company.

48
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,358
It has hundreds of thousands of citizens, 
it has a bureaucracy,

49
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:46,144
it has an entire culture - everything in fact 
but an army.

50
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:53,323
OK Sam we're ready to visit IBM country,
obviously we're dressed for the part.

51
00:03:53,323 --> 00:03:57,445
Now when you were in sales training in 1959 
for IBM did you sing company songs?

52
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,508
- Absolutely.

53
00:03:58,508 --> 00:04:01,300
Well just to get us in the mood 
let's sing one right here.

54
00:04:01,433 --> 00:04:05,289
- You're kidding.
I have the IBM - the songs of the IBM

55
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:07,682
and we're going to try for number 74,

56
00:04:07,682 --> 00:04:11,138
our IBM salesmen sung to the 
tune of Jingle Bells.

57
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,858
(Bob & Sam singing)
'IBM, happy men, smiling all the way...

58
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,587
oh what fun it is to sell...

59
00:04:17,587 --> 00:04:19,980
our pruducts night and day....

60
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,101
IBM Watson men, partners of TJ...

61
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:28,887
In his service to mankind,
that's why we are so gay.'

62
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:33,141
- Now gay didn't mean what it means today 
then remember that OK?

63
00:04:33,141 --> 00:04:34,338
Right ok let's go.

64
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,529
- I guess that was OK.
Perfect.

65
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:46,170
When I started at IBM there was a dress code,

66
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,693
that was an informal oral code of white shirts.

67
00:04:49,693 --> 00:04:51,954
You couldn't wear anything but a white shirt,

68
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,214
generally with a starched collar.

69
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,133
I remember attending my first class, and a 
gentleman said to me

70
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,789
as we were entering the building, 
"are you an IBMer?", and I said yes.

71
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:07,376
He had a three piece suit on, vests were of 
the vogue,

72
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:11,231
and he said:
"could you just lift your pants leg please?"

73
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:15,818
I said what, and before I knew it he had lifted 
my pants leg

74
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:20,670
and he said "you're not wearing any garters!"
I said what?! 

75
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,861
He said "your socks, they're not pulled 
tight to the top",

76
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,514
"you need garters." And sure enough I had 
to go get garters.

77
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,769
IBM is like Switzerland

78
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:35,428
conservative, a little dull, yet prosperous.

79
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:37,887
It has committees to verify each decision.

80
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,746
The safety net is so big that it is hard 
to make a bad decision

81
00:05:40,746 --> 00:05:42,873
or any decision at all.

82
00:05:45,598 --> 00:05:49,254
Rich Seidner, computer programmer and 
wannabe Paul Simon,

83
00:05:49,254 --> 00:05:52,246
spent twenty-five years marching in lockstep 
at IBM.

84
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,240
He feels better now.

85
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,561
I mean it's like... getting four hundred 
thousand people

86
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,422
to agree what they want to have for lunch.

87
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:01,951
You know... I mean it's how can I...

88
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:03,280
it's gonna be lowest common...
you know...

89
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,274
it's going to be, you know...
hot dogs and beans!

90
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,332
So ahm so what you gonna do?

91
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:11,590
So IBM had created this process and 
it absolutely

92
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,179
made sure that quality would be preserved 
throughout the process,

93
00:06:15,179 --> 00:06:17,506
that you actually were doing what you set 
out to do

94
00:06:17,506 --> 00:06:19,699
and what you thought the customer wanted. 

95
00:06:19,699 --> 00:06:23,754
At one point somebody kind of looked at the 
process to see well, you know,

96
00:06:23,821 --> 00:06:26,413
what's it doing and what's the overhead 
built into it,

97
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:29,737
what they found is that it would take at least 
nine months

98
00:06:29,737 --> 00:06:31,133
to ship an empty box.

99
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,985
By the late seventies, even IBM 
had begun to notice

100
00:06:36,052 --> 00:06:39,442
the explosive growth of personal computer 
companies like Apple.

101
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:43,564
(commercial) the Apple 2, small inexpensive 
and simple to use...

102
00:06:44,694 --> 00:06:48,084
What's more, it was a computer business 
they didn't control.

103
00:06:48,217 --> 00:06:52,139
In 1980, IBM decided they wanted a piece 
of this action.

104
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:56,858
There were suddenly tens of thousands of 
people buying

105
00:06:56,858 --> 00:07:00,049
machines of that class and they loved them.

106
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:02,376
They were very happy with them and they 
were showing up

107
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:08,026
in the engineering departments of our clients 
as machines that were brought in

108
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,084
because you can't do the job on your 
mainframe kind of thing.

109
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,538
(commercial) JB wanted to know why I'm doing 
better than all the other managers...

110
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:17,864
it's no secret...I have an Apple,

111
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:21,986
sure there's a big computer three flights down 
but it won't test my options,

112
00:07:21,986 --> 00:07:24,910
do my charts or edit my reports like my Apple.

113
00:07:25,176 --> 00:07:28,899
The people who had gotten it were
religious fanatics about them.

114
00:07:28,899 --> 00:07:33,884
So the concern was we were losing the hearts 
and minds and give me a machine

115
00:07:33,884 --> 00:07:35,480
to win back the hearts and minds.

116
00:07:39,535 --> 00:07:42,526
In business, as in comedy, timing is everything,

117
00:07:42,526 --> 00:07:45,916
and time looked like it might be running out 
for an IBM PC.

118
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,708
I'm visiting an IBMer who took up the challenge.

119
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:57,815
In August 1979, as IBM's top management 
met to discuss their PC crisis,

120
00:07:57,815 --> 00:08:00,806
Bill Lowe ran a small lab in Boca Raton Florida.

121
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,795
- Hello Bob nice to see you.
Nice to see you again. I tried to match 

122
00:08:04,795 --> 00:08:07,786
the IBM dress code how did I do?
- That's terrific, that's terrific.

123
00:08:07,986 --> 00:08:10,113
He knew the company was in a quandary.

124
00:08:10,113 --> 00:08:14,965
Wait another year and the PC industry would be
too big even for IBM to take on.

125
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:19,419
Chairman Frank Carey turned to the 
department heads and said:

126
00:08:19,552 --> 00:08:21,147
"HELP!!!"

127
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:26,266
He kind of said well, what should we do, 
and I said well,

128
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:30,520
we think we know what we would like to do if 
we were going to proceed with our own product

129
00:08:30,587 --> 00:08:35,705
and he said no, he said at IBM it would take 
four years and three hundred people

130
00:08:35,705 --> 00:08:39,228
to do anything, I mean it's just a fact of life.

131
00:08:39,295 --> 00:08:42,486
And I said no sir, we can provide with product 
in a year.

132
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,009
And he abruptly ended the meeting, 
he said you're on Lowe,

133
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:48,202
come back in two weeks and tell me 
what you need.

134
00:08:48,535 --> 00:08:51,925
An IBM product in a year! Ridiculous!

135
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,983
Down in the basement Bill still has the plan.

136
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:58,306
To save time, instead of building a computer 
from scratch,

137
00:08:58,306 --> 00:09:01,564
they would buy components off the shelf 
and assemble them

138
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:05,552
what in IBM speak was called 'open 
architecture.'

139
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:08,743
IBM never did this.

140
00:09:08,809 --> 00:09:12,133
Two weeks later Bill proposed his heresy 
to the Chairman.

141
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:14,327
- And frankly this is it.

142
00:09:14,327 --> 00:09:20,176
- The key decisions were to go with 
an open architecture,

143
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:27,688
- non IBM technology, non IBM software, 
non IBM sales and non IBM service.

144
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:33,006
- And we probably spent a full half of the 
presentation

145
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,327
- carrying the corporate management committee
into this concept.

146
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:40,517
- Because this was a new concept for IBM 
at that point.

147
00:09:40,517 --> 00:09:42,246
Was it a hard sell?

148
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:50,887
- Mr. Carey bought it. And as result of him 
buying it, we got through it.

149
00:09:51,353 --> 00:09:54,012
With the backing of the chairman, 
Bill and his team

150
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:57,801
then set out to break all the IBM rules and 
go for a record.

151
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,127
- We'll put it in the IBM section.

152
00:10:00,859 --> 00:10:03,916
Once IBM decided to do a personal computer

153
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:07,107
and to do it in a year, they couldn't really 
design anything,

154
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:10,098
they just had to slap it together, so that's 
what we'll do.

155
00:10:10,098 --> 00:10:12,292
You have a central processing unit and eh...
let's see...

156
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:21,133
you need a monitor or display and...
a keyboard.

157
00:10:21,665 --> 00:10:26,052
OK: a PC, except it's not, there's something 
missing.

158
00:10:27,382 --> 00:10:31,038
Time for the Cringely crash course in 
elementary computing.

159
00:10:31,769 --> 00:10:35,625
A PC is a boxful of electronic switches, 
a piece of hardware.

160
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,419
It's useless until you tell it what to do.

161
00:10:37,486 --> 00:10:41,275
It requires a program of instructions...
that's software.

162
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:45,928
Every PC requires at least two essential bits of
software in order to work at all.

163
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,188
First it requires a computer language.

164
00:10:48,188 --> 00:10:51,778
That's what you type in to give instructions 
to the computer.

165
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:53,174
To tell it what to do.

166
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:55,301
Remember it was a computer language 
called BASIC

167
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:58,492
that Paul Allen and Bill Gates adapted to the 
Altair...the first PC.

168
00:10:58,757 --> 00:11:01,350
The other bit of software that's required is called 
an operating system

169
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,940
and that's the internal traffic cop that tells 
the computer itself

170
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:10,523
how the keyboard is connected to the screen 
or how to store files on a floppy disk

171
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:13,781
instead of just losing them when you turn off the
PC at the end of the day.

172
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:17,038
Operating systems tend to have boring 
unfriendly names

173
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:22,223
like UNIX and CPM and MS-DOS but, though 
they may be boring,

174
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:26,012
it's an operating system that made Bill Gates 
the richest man in the world.

175
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:29,734
And the story of how that came about is, well,
pretty interesting.

176
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:36,581
So the contest begins. 
Who would IBM buy their software from?

177
00:11:37,179 --> 00:11:41,567
Let's meet the two contenders: the late 
Gary Kildall, then aged 39,

178
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:48,081
a computer Ph.D., and a 24 year old Harvard 
drop-out - Bill Gates.

179
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:52,668
By the time IBM came calling in 1980,

180
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,656
Bill Gates and his small company Microsoft 
was the biggest supplier

181
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:59,714
of computer languages in the fledgling 
PC industry.

182
00:12:00,911 --> 00:12:03,104
(Commercial)
- Many different computer manufacturers,

183
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:06,960
- are making the CPM Operating System standard 
on most models.

184
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,960
For their operating system, though,

185
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,544
the logical guy for the IBMers to see was 
Gary Kildall.

186
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:16,798
He ran a company modestly called 
'Interglactic Digital Research.'

187
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:21,119
Gary had invented the PC's first operating system 
called CP/M.

188
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:26,304
He had already sold 600,000 of them, so he was 
the big cheese of operating systems.

189
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:30,093
- In the early 70s I had a need for an 
operating system myself

190
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:32,885
- and eh it was a very natural thing to write

191
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:37,206
- and it turns out other people had a need for 
an operating system like that and so

192
00:12:37,206 --> 00:12:40,995
- eh it was a very natural thing I wrote it for my own 
use and then started selling it.

193
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:45,382
In Gary's mind it was the dominant thing and 
it would always be the dominant

194
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:48,838
'cos, you know,  Bill did languages and Gary did 
operating systems

195
00:12:48,838 --> 00:12:52,628
and he really honestly believed that would 
never change.

196
00:12:53,292 --> 00:12:56,682
But what would change the balance of power 
in this young industry

197
00:12:56,682 --> 00:12:59,208
was the characters of the two protagonists.

198
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:02,599
- So I knew Gary back when he was an assistant
professor

199
00:13:02,599 --> 00:13:05,258
- at Monterrey Post Grad School and I was simply 
a grad student.

200
00:13:06,055 --> 00:13:11,639
- And went down, sat in his hot tub, smoked dope 
with him and thoroughly enjoyed it all,

201
00:13:11,772 --> 00:13:14,763
- and commiserated and talked nerd stuff.

202
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:18,818
- He liked playing with gadgets, just like Woz did 
and does,

203
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:20,680
- just like I did and do.

204
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:25,865
He wasn't really interested in how you drive 
the business,

205
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:28,191
he worked on projects, things that interested him.

206
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:35,370
He didn't go rushing off to the patent office and 
patent CPM and patent every line of code he could,

207
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:38,761
he didn't try to just squeeze the last dollar out of it.

208
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:46,870
- Gary was not a fighter, Gary avoided conflict, 
Gary hated conflict.

209
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:52,255
- Bill I don't think anyone could say 
backed away from conflict.

210
00:13:55,047 --> 00:13:58,902
Nobody said future billionaires have to be 
nice guys.

211
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:02,226
Here, at the Microsoft Museum, is a shrine to 
Bill's legacy.

212
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,616
Bill Gates hardly fought his way up from the gutter.

213
00:14:05,882 --> 00:14:10,868
Raised in a prosperous Seattle household, his 
mother a homemaker who did charity work,

214
00:14:10,868 --> 00:14:12,862
his father was a successful lawyer.

215
00:14:13,327 --> 00:14:16,850
But beneath the affluence and comfort of 
a perfect American family,

216
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,376
a competitive spirit ran deep.

217
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,431
I ended up spending Memorial Day Weekend 
with him

218
00:14:23,431 --> 00:14:26,555
out at his grandmother's house on Hood Canal.

219
00:14:26,888 --> 00:14:29,879
She turned everything in to a game.

220
00:14:30,278 --> 00:14:36,394
It was a very very very competitive environment,
and if you spent the weekend there,

221
00:14:36,394 --> 00:14:37,790
you were part of the competition,

222
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,177
and it didn't matter whether it was hearts or 
pickleball or swimming to the dock.

223
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:45,368
And you know and there was always a reward 
for winning 

224
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:46,764
and there was always a penalty for losing.

225
00:14:47,096 --> 00:14:49,356
One time, it was funny, I went to

226
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:54,209
Bill's house and he really wanted to show me his 
jigsaw puzzle that he was working on, 

227
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:58,131
and he really wanted to talk about how he did 
this jigsaw puzzle in like four minutes,

228
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:02,252
and like on the box it said, if you're a genius you
will do the jigsaw puzzle in like seven.

229
00:15:02,252 --> 00:15:05,775
And he was into it. He was like "I can do it". And I 
said don't, you know, I believe you.

230
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:08,633
You don't need to break it up and do it for me. 
You know.

231
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:11,891
Bill Gates can be so focused

232
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:14,417
that the small things in life get overlooked.

233
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:18,139
If he was busy he didn't bathe, he didn't 
change clothes.

234
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:22,593
We were in New York and the demo that we 
had crashed

235
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:28,376
the evening before the announcement, and Bill 
worked all night with some other engineers to fix it.

236
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:32,697
Well it didn't occur to him to take ten minutes 
for a shower after that,

237
00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:35,356
it just didn't occur to him that that was important,

238
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:38,813
and he badly needed a shower that day.

239
00:15:43,998 --> 00:15:45,593
The scene is set:

240
00:15:45,593 --> 00:15:51,842
in California laid back Gary Kildall already making
the best selling PC operating system: CPM.

241
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,428
In Seattle Bill Gates maker of BASIC the best selling 
PC language

242
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:59,885
but always prepared to seize an opportunity.

243
00:16:00,683 --> 00:16:03,142
So IBM had to choose one of these guys

244
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:06,134
to write the operating system for its new 
personal computer.

245
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,457
One would hit the jackpot the other 
would be forgotten,

246
00:16:09,524 --> 00:16:12,382
a footnote in the history of the personal computer,

247
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:15,440
and it all starts with a telephone call to an 
eighth floor office

248
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,093
in that building the headquarters of Microsoft 
in 1980.

249
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:27,472
At about noon I guess I called Bill Gates on Monday

250
00:16:27,472 --> 00:16:31,061
and said I would like to come out and talk with him 
about his products.

251
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:34,584
Bill said well, how's next week, and they said we're 
on an airplane,

252
00:16:34,584 --> 00:16:39,437
we're leaving in an hour, we'd like to be there 
tomorrow. Well, hallelujah. Right oh.

253
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:43,292
Steve Ballmer was a Harvard roommate of Gates.

254
00:16:43,292 --> 00:16:47,015
He'd just joined Microsoft and would end up 
its third billionaire.

255
00:16:47,015 --> 00:16:50,738
Back then he was the only guy in the company 
with business training.

256
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:55,856
Both Ballmer and Gates instantly saw the
importance of the IBM visit.

257
00:16:56,521 --> 00:16:58,781
And Bill said Steve, you'd better come to 
the meeting,

258
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:00,376
you're the only other guy here who can wear a suit.

259
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,972
A lot of these computer fairs discussions would get 
around to, you know, I...

260
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:04,564
 we'll put on suits and we'll go to this meeting.

261
00:17:04,697 --> 00:17:07,622
We got there at roughly two o'clock

262
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:11,876
and we were waiting in the front,

263
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,865
and this young fella came out to take us back to 
Mr. Gates office.

264
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:19,255
I thought he was the office boy, and of course 
it was Bill.

265
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:23,376
He was quite decisive, we popped out the 
non-disclosure agreement

266
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,969
the letter that said he wouldn't tell anybody 
we were there

267
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:28,761
and that we wouldn't hear any secrets and so forth.

268
00:17:29,558 --> 00:17:31,087
 He signed it immediately.

269
00:17:31,087 --> 00:17:35,009
IBM didn't make it easy. You had to sign all these 
funny agreements that sort of said

270
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:39,330
I...IBM could do whatever they wanted, 
whenever they wanted

271
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,255
and use your secrets however they - they felt.

272
00:17:42,388 --> 00:17:44,914
But so it took a little bit of faith.

273
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:48,637
Jack Sams was looking for a package from Microsoft

274
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:52,692
containing both the BASIC computer language 
and an Operating System.

275
00:17:53,223 --> 00:17:55,616
But IBM hadn't done their homework.

276
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,209
They thought we had an operating system.

277
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:02,131
Because we had this Soft Card product that 
had CPM on it, they thought

278
00:18:02,131 --> 00:18:04,524
we could licence them CPM for this new 
personal computer

279
00:18:04,524 --> 00:18:09,975
they told us they wanted to do, and we said well, 
no, we're not in that business.

280
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:13,631
When we discovered we didn't have - 
he didn't have the rights to do that

281
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,819
and that it was not...he said but I think it's ready, 
I think that Gary's got it ready to go.

282
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,741
So I said well, there's no time like the present, 
call up Gary.

283
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,995
And so Bill right there with them in the room, 
called Gary Kildall at Digital Research

284
00:18:25,995 --> 00:18:27,723
and said Gary, I'm sending some guys down.

285
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:30,582
They're going to be on the phone. Treat them right, 
they're important guys.

286
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:36,631
The men from IBM came to this Victorian House 
in Pacific Grove California,

287
00:18:36,631 --> 00:18:40,686
headquarters of Digital Research, headed by 
Gary and Dorothy Kildall.

288
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:43,943
Just imagine what its like having IBM come to visit,

289
00:18:43,943 --> 00:18:48,197
its like having the Queen drop by for tea, 
its like having the Pope come by looking for advice,

290
00:18:48,197 --> 00:18:50,391
its like a visit from God himself.

291
00:18:50,989 --> 00:18:52,984
And what did Gary and Dorothy do? 

292
00:18:53,183 --> 00:18:54,446
They sent them away.

293
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:57,903
Gary had some other plans and so he said well,

294
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:02,024
Dorothy will see you. So we went down the three 
of us...

295
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:07,009
IBM showed up with an IBM non-disclosure and 
Dorothy made what I...

296
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:11,064
a decision which I think it's easy in retrospect to say
was dumb.

297
00:19:11,397 --> 00:19:15,917
We popped out our letter that said please don't tell 
anybody we're here,

298
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:18,044
and we don't want to hear anything confidential.

299
00:19:18,044 --> 00:19:20,238
And she read it and said and "I can't sign this".

300
00:19:21,168 --> 00:19:24,625
She did what her job was, she got the lawyer 
to look at the nondisclosure.

301
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:31,206
The lawyer, Gerry Davis who's still in Monterey 
threw up on this non-disclosure.

302
00:19:31,206 --> 00:19:35,593
It was uncomfortable for IBM, they weren't used 
to waiting.

303
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:40,712
And it was unfortunate situation - here you are in a 
tiny Victorian House,

304
00:19:41,044 --> 00:19:43,570
its overrun with people, chaotic.

305
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:48,622
So we spent the whole day in Pacific Grove 
debating with them

306
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:51,614
and with our attorneys and her attorneys and 
everybody else about whether or not

307
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:55,934
she could even talk to us about talking to us,

308
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,862
and we left.

309
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:02,515
This is the moment Digital Research dropped 
the ball.

310
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:06,969
IBM, distinctly unimpressed with their reception, 
went back to Microsoft.

311
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,290
Bill Gates isn't the man to give a rival 
a second chance.

312
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:14,148
He saw the opportunity of a lifetime.

313
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,538
Digital research didn't seize that, and we knew 
it was essential,

314
00:20:17,538 --> 00:20:20,064
if somebody didn't do it, the project was going 
to fall apart.

315
00:20:20,463 --> 00:20:23,521
We just got carried away and said look, we can't 
afford to lose the language business.

316
00:20:23,654 --> 00:20:26,712
That was the initial thought - we can't afford to have
IBM not go forward.

317
00:20:26,712 --> 00:20:29,105
This is the most exciting thing that's going to 
happen in PCs.

318
00:20:29,304 --> 00:20:31,105
And we were already out on a limb,

319
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:37,215
because we had licensed them not only Basic, 
but Fortran, Cobol Assembler er,

320
00:20:37,481 --> 00:20:39,209
Typing Tutor and Venture.

321
00:20:39,209 --> 00:20:42,001
And basically every - every product 
the company had

322
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:45,590
we had committed to do for IBM in a very short 
time frame.

323
00:20:45,989 --> 00:20:47,319
But there was a problem.

324
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:52,038
IBM needed an operating system fast and 
Microsoft didn't have one.

325
00:20:52,304 --> 00:20:57,157
What they had was a stroke of luck - the ingredient 
everyone needs to be a billionaire.

326
00:20:57,556 --> 00:21:00,547
Unbelievably, the solution was just across town.

327
00:21:00,547 --> 00:21:03,871
Paul Allen, Gates's programming partner 
since high school,

328
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,998
had found another operating system.

329
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:10,252
There's a local company here in CL called 
CL Computer Products

330
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:14,640
by a guy named Tim Patterson and he had done 
an operating system

331
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,498
a very rudimentary operating system that was 
kind of like CPM.

332
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:22,018
And we just told IBM look, we'll go and get this 
operating system from this small local company,

333
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:25,674
we'll take care of it, we'll fix it up, and you can still 
do a PC.

334
00:21:26,273 --> 00:21:29,929
Tim Patterson's operating system, which saved 
the deal with IBM,

335
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,851
was, well, adapted from Gary Kildall's CPM.

336
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,839
So I took a CPM manual that I'd gotten from the 
Retail Computer Store five dollars

337
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:45,151
in 1976 or something, and used that as the basis for
 what would be the application program interface,

338
00:21:45,151 --> 00:21:47,151
the API for my operating system.

339
00:21:47,943 --> 00:21:54,591
And so using these ideas that came from different 
places I started in April

340
00:21:54,591 --> 00:22:00,374
and it was about half time for four months before I 
had my first working version.

341
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:04,096
This is it, the operating system Tim Patterson wrote.

342
00:22:04,096 --> 00:22:07,686
He called in QDOS the quick and dirty 
operating system.

343
00:22:07,686 --> 00:22:14,400
Microsoft and IBM called it PC DOS 1.0 and under 
any name it looks an awful lot like CPM.

344
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,654
On this computer here I have running a PC DOS and
CPM 86

345
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:21,247
and frankly it\CDs very hard to tell the difference 
between the two.

346
00:22:21,247 --> 00:22:23,773
The command structures are the same, 
so are the directories,

347
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:29,556
in fact the only obvious external difference is the 
floppy dirive is labelled A in PC DOS

348
00:22:30,287 --> 00:22:32,348
and and C in CPM.

349
00:22:32,547 --> 00:22:37,134
Some difference and yet one generated billions in 
revenue and the other disappeared.

350
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,591
As usual in the PC business the prize didn't go to 
the inventor

351
00:22:40,591 --> 00:22:42,917
but to the exploiter of the invention.

352
00:22:42,984 --> 00:22:47,371
In this case that wasn't Gary Kildall, it wasn't even 
Tim Paterson.

353
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:49,498
There was still one problem.

354
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:54,151
Tim Patterson worked for Seattle Computer 
Products, or SCP.

355
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:58,937
They still owned the rights to QDOS,
rights that Microsoft had to have.

356
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:03,192
But then we went back and said to them look, 
you know,

357
00:23:03,192 --> 00:23:08,776
we want to buy this thing, and SCP was like most 
little companies, you know.

358
00:23:08,776 --> 00:23:12,498
They always needed cash and so that was when 
they went in to the negotiation.

359
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:21,539
- And so ended up working out a deal to buy the 
operating system from him 

360
00:23:21,937 --> 00:23:25,328
- for whatever usage we wanted for 
fifty thousand dollars.

361
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:30,380
Hey, let's pause there. 
To savour an historic moment.

362
00:23:30,845 --> 00:23:33,836
- for whatever usage we wanted for 
fifty thousand dollars.

363
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,958
It had to be the deal of the century if not 
the millenium,

364
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,611
it was certainly the deal that made Bill Gates 
and Paul Allen multi billionaires

365
00:23:42,611 --> 00:23:47,929
and allowed Paul Allen to buy toys like these, his own
NBA basketball team and arena.

366
00:23:48,195 --> 00:23:52,516
Microsoft bought outright for fifty thousand dollars 
the operating system they needed

367
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:57,235
and they turned around and licensed it to the world 
for up to fifty dollars per PC.

368
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:01,224
Think of it: one hundred million personal computers 
running MS DOS software

369
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:05,146
funnelling billions into Microsoft - a company that 
back then was

370
00:24:05,146 --> 00:24:09,334
fifty kids managed by a twenty-five year old 
who needed to wash his hair.

371
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:13,455
Nice work if you can get it and Microsoft got it.

372
00:24:17,776 --> 00:24:22,362
There are no two places further apart in the USA 
than south eastern Florida

373
00:24:22,362 --> 00:24:24,556
and Washington State where Microsoft is based.

374
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:26,550
This - this is Florida,

375
00:24:26,683 --> 00:24:30,938
Boca Raton and this building right here is where the 
IBM PC was developed.

376
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:37,452
Here the nerds from Seattle joined forces 
with the suits of corporate

377
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,839
and in that first honeymoon year they pulled off
a fantastic achievement.

378
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:46,160
- After we got a package in the mail from the people 
down in Florida...

379
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,013
As August 1981 approached, the deadline for the 
launch of the IBM Acorn,

380
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:53,472
the PC industry held its breath.

381
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:56,597
- Supposedly, maybe at this very moment eh,

382
00:24:56,597 --> 00:25:00,186
- IBM is announcing the personal computer. 
We don't know that yet.

383
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,241
In companies across America, software writers 
like Dan Bricklin,

384
00:25:04,308 --> 00:25:05,637
the creator of the first spreadsheet,

385
00:25:05,903 --> 00:25:08,562
waited with their staff for the news of 
the announcement.

386
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:16,539
This is a moment of PC history. IBM secrecy had 
codenamed the PC 'The Floridian Project.'

387
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:20,860
Everyone in the PC business knew IBM would 
change their world forever.

388
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,050
They also knew that if their software was 
on the IBM PC,

389
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,178
they would make fortunes.

390
00:25:26,178 --> 00:25:31,097
-...the attached information is not to be disclosed 
prior to any public announcement.

391
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:34,819
- It's on the ticker
- It's on the ticker OK so now you can tell people.

392
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:40,469
What we're watching, are the first few seconds 
of a $100 billion industry.

393
00:25:44,458 --> 00:25:48,912
(promos) After years of thinking big today IBM 
came up with something small...

394
00:25:49,177 --> 00:25:52,701
...Big Blue is looking for a slice of Apple's 
market share...

395
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:55,891
...Bits and Bytes mean nothing try this one...

396
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,478
...Now they're going to sell $1,000 computers 
to millions of customers...

397
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:04,533
...I have seen the future said one analyst 
and it computes.

398
00:26:10,981 --> 00:26:14,172
Nobody was ever fired for buying IBM.

399
00:26:14,371 --> 00:26:19,822
Now companies could put PCs with the name they
trusted on desks from Wisconsin to Wall Street.

400
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:26,071
What IBM said was it's okay corporate America for 
you to now start buying and using PCs.

401
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:30,258
And if it's okay for corporate America, it's got 
to be okay for everybody.

402
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:37,571
For all the hype, the IBM PC wasn't much better 
than what came before.

403
00:26:37,837 --> 00:26:40,762
So while the IBM name could create 
immense demand,

404
00:26:40,894 --> 00:26:43,686
it took a killer application to sustain it.

405
00:26:45,747 --> 00:26:49,137
The killer app for the IBM PC was yet 
another spreadsheet.

406
00:26:49,137 --> 00:26:54,056
Based on Visicalc, but called Lotus 1-2-3, 
its creators were the first of many

407
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:56,056
to get rich on IBM's success.

408
00:26:56,449 --> 00:26:58,643
Within a year Lotus was worth $150 million bucks.

409
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:01,169
Wham! Bam! Thank you IBM!

410
00:27:06,088 --> 00:27:10,741
IBM had forecast sales of half a million computers
by 1984.

411
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:15,328
In those 3 years, they sold 2 million.

412
00:27:15,727 --> 00:27:17,987
Euphoric I guess is the right word.

413
00:27:17,987 --> 00:27:22,175
Everybody was believed that they were 
not going to...

414
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:25,698
At that point two million or three million, 
you know,

415
00:27:25,698 --> 00:27:27,626
they were now thinking in terms of a hundred
million and

416
00:27:27,626 --> 00:27:29,952
they were probably off the scale 
in the other direction.

417
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,735
What did all this mean to Bill Gates, 
whose operating system, DOS,

418
00:27:35,735 --> 00:27:38,195
was at the heart of every IBM PC sold?

419
00:27:38,195 --> 00:27:41,519
Initially, not much, because of the deal with IBM.

420
00:27:41,917 --> 00:27:45,906
But it did give him a vital bridgehead to 
other players in the PC marketplace,

421
00:27:45,906 --> 00:27:49,429
which meant trouble in the long run for Big Blue.

422
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:55,678
The key to our...the structure of our deal was that 
IBM had no control over...

423
00:27:55,678 --> 00:27:57,678
over our licensing to other people.

424
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:02,458
In a lesson on the computer industry in 
mainframes was that er, over time,

425
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:07,045
people built compatible machines or clones, 
whatever term you want to use,

426
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:11,831
and so really, the primary upside on the deal 
we had with IBM,

427
00:28:11,831 --> 00:28:15,088
because they had a fixed fee er, we got about
$80,000

428
00:28:15,088 --> 00:28:18,412
we got some other money for some special work 
we did er,

429
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:22,201
but no royalty from them.

430
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,192
And that's the DOS and Basic as well.

431
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:30,510
And so we were hoping a lot of other people 
would come along and do compatible machines.

432
00:28:33,368 --> 00:28:37,756
There were other PCs that were sorta like the 
IBM PC, kinda like it.

433
00:28:38,287 --> 00:28:42,808
But IBM now had fifty per cent market share and 
was defining what a PC meant.

434
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:46,264
What the public wanted was IBM PCs.

435
00:28:46,397 --> 00:28:52,380
So to be successful other manufacturers would 
have to build computers exactly like the IBM.

436
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:56,701
They wanted to copy the IBM PC, to clone it.

437
00:28:57,033 --> 00:28:58,695
How could they do that legally?

438
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,883
Well, welcome to the world of reverse engineering.

439
00:29:19,169 --> 00:29:22,958
This is what reverse engineering can get you 
if you do it right.

440
00:29:24,421 --> 00:29:27,611
It's the modest Aspen, Colorado ski shack of 
Rod Canion,

441
00:29:27,744 --> 00:29:32,996
one of the founders of Compaq, the company set 
up to compete head-on with the IBM PC.

442
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:37,582
Back in 1982, Rod and three fellow engineers 
from Texas Instruments

443
00:29:37,715 --> 00:29:42,900
sketched out a computer design on a place mat 
at the House of Pies restaurant in Houston, Texas.

444
00:29:43,299 --> 00:29:47,620
They decided to manufacture and market 
a portable version of the IBM PC

445
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:51,276
using the curious technique of 
reverse engineering.

446
00:29:51,675 --> 00:29:55,464
Reverse engineering is figuring out after something 
has already been created

447
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:57,923
how it ticks, what makes it work,

448
00:29:58,123 --> 00:30:01,979
usually for the purpose of creating something
that works the same way or at least does

449
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:05,369
something like the thing you're trying to 
reverse engineer.

450
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:11,218
Here's how you clone a PC.

451
00:30:11,484 --> 00:30:13,345
IBM had made it easy to copy.

452
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,736
The microprocessor was available off the shelf 
from Intel

453
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:18,929
and the other parts came from many sources.

454
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:24,845
Only one part was IBM's alone, a vital chip that 
connected the hardware with the software.

455
00:30:28,435 --> 00:30:33,022
Called the ROM-BIOS, this was IBM's own design, 
protected by copyright

456
00:30:33,022 --> 00:30:35,216
and Big Blue's army of lawyers.

457
00:30:35,614 --> 00:30:40,068
Compaq had to somehow copy the chip 
without breaking the law.

458
00:30:40,533 --> 00:30:44,189
- First you have to decide how the ROM works,

459
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:51,169
- so what we had to do was have an engineer sit 
down with that code

460
00:30:51,169 --> 00:30:53,169
- and through trial and error write a specification 
that said

461
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:57,218
- here's how the BIOS ROM needs to work.
It couldn't be close it had to be exact

462
00:30:57,285 --> 00:30:59,944
- so there was a lot of detailed testing that went on.

463
00:31:00,742 --> 00:31:05,262
You test how that all-important chip behaves, 
and make a list of what it has to do

464
00:31:05,262 --> 00:31:07,788
now it's time to meet my lawyer, Claude.

465
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:14,302
I've examined the internals of the ROM BIOS and 
written this book of specifications

466
00:31:14,302 --> 00:31:17,559
now I need some help because I've done 
as much as I can do,

467
00:31:17,892 --> 00:31:21,947
and you need to explain what's next.

468
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:25,603
- Well, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to 
go through the book of specifications myself,

469
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:28,129
- but the first thing I can tell you Robert is that 
you're out of it now.

470
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:30,522
- You are contaminated, you are dirty.

471
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:35,175
- You've seen the product that's the original work 
of authorship, you've seen the target product,

472
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:38,299
- so now from here on in we're going to be working 
with people who are not dirty.

473
00:31:38,299 --> 00:31:40,227
- We're going to be working with so called virgins,

474
00:31:40,227 --> 00:31:42,022
- who are going to be operating in the clean room.

475
00:31:42,022 --> 00:31:43,684
I certainly don't qualify there.

476
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,013
- I imagine you don't.

477
00:31:45,013 --> 00:31:48,603
- So what we're going to do is this: we're going to 
hire a group of engineers

478
00:31:49,002 --> 00:31:51,395
- who have never seen the IBM ROM BIOS.

479
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,051
- They have never seen it, they have never operated
it, they know nothing about it.

480
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:58,707
(Claude interrogates Mark) - Have you ever before 
attempted to disassemble decompile or to

481
00:31:58,707 --> 00:32:02,496
- in any way shape or form reverse engineer any IBM
equipment?

482
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:03,759
Oh no.

483
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,354
- And have you ever tried to disassemble...

484
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:08,013
This is the Silicon Valley virginity test.

485
00:32:08,013 --> 00:32:10,478
And good virgins are hard to find.

486
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:13,929
- You understand that in the event that we discover 
that the information you are providing us

487
00:32:13,996 --> 00:32:16,522
- is inaccurate you are subject to discipline by 
the company

488
00:32:16,522 --> 00:32:19,713
- and that can include but not limited to termination 
immediately do you understand that?

489
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,909
Yes I do.
- OK

490
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,568
After the virgins are deemed intact,

491
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:27,557
they are forbidden contact with the outside world 
while they build a new chip,

492
00:32:27,623 --> 00:32:30,814
one that behaves exactly like the one in 
the specifications.

493
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:36,265
In Compaq's case, it took 15 senior programmers 
several months and cost $1 million

494
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,794
to do the reverse engineering.

495
00:32:38,126 --> 00:32:41,583
In November 1982, Rod Canion unveiled the result.

496
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,638
- What I've brought today is a Compaq 
portable computer.

497
00:32:45,638 --> 00:32:49,958
When Bill Murto, another Compaq founder got 
a plug on a cable TV show

498
00:32:49,958 --> 00:32:53,814
their selling point was clear: 100 percent 
IBM compatibility.

499
00:32:53,814 --> 00:32:56,672
- ...It turns out that all major popular software runs

500
00:32:56,672 --> 00:32:59,730
- on the IBM personal computer or the Compaq 
portable computer.

501
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:02,655
-- That extends through all of this software for IBM?

502
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:03,519
- Eh Yes.

503
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,848
-- It all works on the Compaq?

504
00:33:04,848 --> 00:33:08,771
The Compaq was an instant hit. 
In their first year,

505
00:33:08,771 --> 00:33:14,088
on the strength of being exactly like IBM but a little 
cheaper, they sold 47,000 PCs.

506
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:17,678
- In our first year of sales we set an American 
business record.

507
00:33:17,678 --> 00:33:21,002
- I guess maybe a world business record. 
Largest first year sales in history.

508
00:33:21,002 --> 00:33:22,730
- It was a hundred and eleven million dollars.

509
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:33,366
So Rod Canion ends up in Aspen, famous for having 
the most expensive real estate in America

510
00:33:33,366 --> 00:33:36,291
and I try not to look envious while Rod tells me

511
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,950
which executive jet he plans to buy next.

512
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,207
- And finally I picked the Lear 31.
Oh really?

513
00:33:42,473 --> 00:33:44,135
- Now that was a fun airplane.
Oh yeh.

514
00:33:44,135 --> 00:33:49,519
Poor Big Blue! Suddenly everybody was cashing in 
on IBM's success.

515
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,039
The most obvious winner at first was Intel, 
maker of the PCs microprocessor chip.

516
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,230
Intel was selling chips like hotcakes to 
clonemakers,

517
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:01,086
and making them smaller, quicker and cheaper. 
This was unheard of!

518
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:05,340
What kind of an industry had Big Blue 
gotten themselves into?

519
00:34:05,672 --> 00:34:10,060
- Things get less expensive every year. People 
aren't used to that in general.

520
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,060
- I mean, you buy a new car, you buy one now

521
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,843
- and four years later you go and buy one it costs 
more than the one you bought before.

522
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,768
- Here is this magical piece of an industry,

523
00:34:19,233 --> 00:34:24,484
- you go buy one later it costs less, and it does 
more, what a wonderful thing!

524
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:29,071
- But it causes some funny things to occur when 
you think about an industry. 

525
00:34:29,204 --> 00:34:32,993
- An industry where prices are coming down, 
where you have to sell it and use it right now,

526
00:34:32,993 --> 00:34:34,854
because if you wait later it's worthless.

527
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:42,034
Where Compaq led, others soon followed.

528
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:47,086
IBM was now facing dozens of rivals - soon to be 
familiar names began to appear,

529
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:49,878
like Amstrad, AST and Dell.

530
00:34:49,878 --> 00:34:52,803
It was getting spectacularly easy to build a clone.

531
00:34:52,803 --> 00:34:57,722
You could get everything off the shelf, including 
a guaranteed-virgin ROM BIOS chip.

532
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:04,369
Each new clonemaker, free of IBM's big overhead,
took another bite of the big blue business.

533
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:09,687
Well, they really hit with a vengeance in '85, 
the prices were going down

534
00:35:09,687 --> 00:35:14,672
on the competitive products had about 30% 
every six months.

535
00:35:15,603 --> 00:35:19,857
- Terror would be a good phrase.
Terror?

536
00:35:19,857 --> 00:35:22,982
- Oh, of course. I mean we were able to sell 
a lot of products

537
00:35:22,982 --> 00:35:24,776
- but it was getting difficult to make money.

538
00:35:25,508 --> 00:35:28,499
And where did every clone-maker buy his 
operating system?

539
00:35:28,499 --> 00:35:29,962
Microsoft, of course.

540
00:35:30,028 --> 00:35:32,487
By the mid 80's it was boom time for Bill.

541
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,875
The teenage entrepreneur had predicted a PC on 
every desk and in every home,

542
00:35:36,875 --> 00:35:40,664
running Microsoft software, it was actually 
coming true.

543
00:35:42,126 --> 00:35:46,447
As Microsoft mushroomed there was no way that 
Bill Gates could personally dominate 

544
00:35:46,447 --> 00:35:49,505
thousands of employees but that didn't stop him.

545
00:35:49,505 --> 00:35:53,626
He still had a need to be both industry titan 
and top programmer.

546
00:35:53,892 --> 00:35:56,883
So he had to come up with a whole new corporate 
culture for Microsoft.

547
00:35:56,883 --> 00:36:00,672
He had to find a way to satisfy both his adolescent
need to dominate

548
00:36:00,672 --> 00:36:02,534
and his adult need to inspire.

549
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:07,187
From the beginning, Microsoft recruited 
straight out of college.

550
00:36:07,253 --> 00:36:10,710
They chose people who had no experience of life 
in other companies.

551
00:36:10,843 --> 00:36:13,435
In time they'd be called Microserfs.

552
00:36:13,901 --> 00:36:19,352
And so a lot of young, I say people, but mostly 
it was young men,

553
00:36:19,352 --> 00:36:26,464
who just were out of school saw him as this 
incredible role model or leader,

554
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,924
almost a guru I guess.

555
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:36,103
And they could spend hours with him and he 
valued their contributions

556
00:36:36,502 --> 00:36:38,297
and there was just a wonderful camaraderie

557
00:36:38,297 --> 00:36:42,219
that seemed to exist between all these 
young men and Bill,

558
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:47,736
and this strength that he has and his will and his 
desire to be the best

559
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:53,320
and to be the winner - he is just like a cult leader, 
really.

560
00:36:56,245 --> 00:37:00,499
As the frenzied 80's came to a close IBM reached 
a watershed

561
00:37:00,499 --> 00:37:03,889
they had created an open PC architecture that 
anyone could copy.

562
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:08,675
This was intentional but IBM always thought their 
inside track would keep them ahead.

563
00:37:08,675 --> 00:37:10,005
Wrong.

564
00:37:10,071 --> 00:37:14,658
IBM's glacial pace and high overhead put them at 
a disadvantage to the leaner clone makers

565
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:19,444
everything was turning into a nightmare as IBM 
lost its dominant market share.

566
00:37:19,644 --> 00:37:23,499
So in a big gamble they staked their PC future 
to a new system

567
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:29,482
a new line of computers with proprietary closed 
hardware and their very own operating system.

568
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,742
It was war.

569
00:37:32,274 --> 00:37:35,132
(Presentation)
- ...start planning for operating system 2 today...

570
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:39,652
IBM planned to steal the market from Gates with 
a brand new operating system, called

571
00:37:39,652 --> 00:37:43,707
- drum roll please -
OS/2.

572
00:37:45,968 --> 00:37:50,621
IBM would design OS/2. Yet they asked Microsoft 
to write the code.

573
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,811
Why would Microsoft help create what was 
intended to be the instrument

574
00:37:53,811 --> 00:37:55,606
of their own destruction?

575
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:58,930
Because Microsoft knew IBM was was the source 
of their success

576
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:03,051
and they would tolerate almost anything 
to stay close to Big Blue.

577
00:38:03,583 --> 00:38:07,239
It was just part of, as we used to call it, the time 
riding the bear.

578
00:38:07,572 --> 00:38:11,294
You just had to try to stay on the bear's back and 
the bear would twist and turn

579
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:15,415
and try to buck you and throw you, but darn, 
we were going to ride the bear

580
00:38:15,415 --> 00:38:20,002
because the bear was the biggest, the most 
important you just had to be with the bear,

581
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:24,190
otherwise you would be under the bear in the 
computer industry, and IBM was the bear,

582
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,317
and we were going to ride the back of the bear.

583
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:32,433
It's easy for people to forget how pervasive IBM's 
influence over this industry was.

584
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:35,092
When you talked to people who've come in to the 
industry recently

585
00:38:35,092 --> 00:38:38,282
there's no way you can get that in to their,
in to their head,

586
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,077
that was the environment.

587
00:38:41,407 --> 00:38:45,994
The relationship between IBM and Microsoft 
was always a culture clash.

588
00:38:46,193 --> 00:38:49,251
IBMers were buttoned-up organization men. 

589
00:38:50,181 --> 00:38:52,907
Microsoftees were obsessive hackers.

590
00:38:53,638 --> 00:38:57,427
With the development of OS/2 the strains 
really began to show.

591
00:38:57,892 --> 00:39:01,482
In IBM there's a religion in software that says you 
have to count K-LOCs,

592
00:39:01,482 --> 00:39:04,806
and a K-LOC is a thousand line of code.

593
00:39:04,806 --> 00:39:08,395
How big a project is it? Oh, it's sort of a 10K-LOC 
project.

594
00:39:08,395 --> 00:39:13,048
This is a 20K-LOCer. And this is 5OK-LOCs.

595
00:39:13,048 --> 00:39:17,835
And IBM wanted to sort of make it the religion 
about how we got paid.

596
00:39:17,835 --> 00:39:21,889
How much money we made off OS 2, how much 
they did. How many K-LOCs did you do?

597
00:39:22,022 --> 00:39:25,878
and we kept trying to convince them: hey, if we 
have - a developer's got a good idea

598
00:39:25,878 --> 00:39:30,464
and he can get something done in 4K-LOCs 
instead of 20K-LOCs,

599
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:32,326
should we make less money?

600
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:35,915
Because he's made something smaller and 
faster, less KLOC.

601
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:38,907
K-LOCs, K-LOCs, that's the methodology.

602
00:39:39,372 --> 00:39:46,219
Ugh anyway, that always makes my back just 
crinkle up at the thought of the whole thing.

603
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:51,670
When I took over in '89 there was an enormous 
amount of resources working on OS 2,

604
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:54,262
both in Microsoft and the IBM company.

605
00:39:54,262 --> 00:40:00,112
Bill Gates and I met on that several times. And 
we pretty quickly came to the conclusion together

606
00:40:00,112 --> 00:40:04,167
that that was not going to be a success, 
the way it was being managed.

607
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:12,476
It was also pretty clear that the negotiating and 
the contracts

608
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:17,196
had given most of that control to Microsoft.

609
00:40:18,725 --> 00:40:24,242
It was no longer just a question of styles. There 
was now a clear conflict of business interest.

610
00:40:25,106 --> 00:40:28,098
OS/2 was planned to undermine the 
clone market,

611
00:40:28,098 --> 00:40:30,690
where DOS was still Microsoft's major 
money-maker.

612
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:35,609
Microsoft was DOS. But Microsoft was helping 
develop the opposition?

613
00:40:36,274 --> 00:40:39,199
Bad idea. To keep DOS competitive,

614
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,254
Gates had been pouring resources into 
a new programme called Windows.

615
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:49,569
It was designed to provide a nice user-friendly 
facade to boring old DOS.

616
00:40:50,433 --> 00:40:54,488
Selling it was another job for shy, retiring 
Steve Ballmer.

617
00:40:54,887 --> 00:40:58,210
- How much do you think this advanced operating
environment is worth?

618
00:40:58,210 --> 00:41:00,204
- wait just one minute before you answer

619
00:41:00,338 --> 00:41:05,722
- watch as Windows integrates Lotus 1, 2, 3 with 
Miami Vice. Now we can take this...

620
00:41:06,121 --> 00:41:10,375
Just as Bill Gates saw OS/2 as a threat, 
IBM regarded Windows

621
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:14,430
as another attempt by Microsoft to hold on to 
the operating system business.

622
00:41:14,895 --> 00:41:19,948
We created Windows in parallel. We kept saying to 
IBM, hey, Windows is the way to go,

623
00:41:20,014 --> 00:41:24,002
graphics is the way to go, and we got virtually 
everyone else,

624
00:41:24,002 --> 00:41:28,589
enthused about Windows. So that was a 
divergence that we kept thinking

625
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:31,846
we could get IBM to - to come around on.

626
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:36,765
It was clear that IBM had a different vision of its 
relationship with Microsoft

627
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:39,757
than Microsoft had of its vision with IBM.

628
00:41:40,554 --> 00:41:42,416
Was that Microsoft's fault?

629
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:48,531
You know, maybe some ,but IBM's not 
blameless there either.

630
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:54,248
So I don't view any of that as anything but 
just poor business on IBM's part.

631
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:01,560
Bill Gates is a very disciplined guy.

632
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,621
He puts aside everything he wants to read,

633
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:06,612
and twice a year goes away for secluded 
reading weeks.

634
00:42:07,144 --> 00:42:11,864
The decisive moment in the Microsoft/IBM 
relationship came during just such a retreat.

635
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,921
In front of a log fire Bill concluded that it was 
no longer

636
00:42:14,921 --> 00:42:18,577
in Microsoft's long term interests to 
blindly follow IBM.

637
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,430
If Bill had to choose between OS2, IBM's 
new operating system and Windows,

638
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,026
he'd choose Windows.

639
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:27,950
We said ooh, IBM's probably not going to like this.

640
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,546
This is going to threaten OS 2.

641
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:33,335
Now we told them about it, right away we told 
them about it, but we still did it.

642
00:42:33,667 --> 00:42:35,595
They didn't like it, we told em about it, 
we told em about it,

643
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,456
we offered to licence it to em.

644
00:42:38,187 --> 00:42:42,641
We always thought the best thing to do is to try 
and combine

645
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:46,962
IBM promoting the software with us doing 
the engineering.

646
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:51,815
And so it was only when they broke off 
communication and decided to go their own way

647
00:42:51,815 --> 00:42:54,407
that we thought, okay, we're on our own,

648
00:42:54,341 --> 00:42:56,534
and that was definitely very, very scary.

649
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,317
We were in a major negotiation in early 1990, 
right before the Windows launch.

650
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:05,907
We wanted to have IBM on stage with us 
to launch Windows 3.0,

651
00:43:05,907 --> 00:43:11,956
but they wouldn't do the kind of deal that would 
allow us to profit it would allow them

652
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:15,612
essentially to take over Windows from us, and we
walked away from the deal.

653
00:43:17,739 --> 00:43:22,127
Jack Sams, who started IBM's relationship with 
Microsoft with that first call

654
00:43:22,127 --> 00:43:27,511
to Bill Gates in 1980, could only look on as the 
partnership disintegrated.

655
00:43:28,242 --> 00:43:31,367
Then they at that point I think they agreed 
to disagree

656
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:36,419
on the future progress of OS 2 and Windows.

657
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:42,601
And internally we were told thou shalt not ship 
any more products on Windows.

658
00:43:44,063 --> 00:43:48,118
And about that time I got the opportunity 
to take early retirement so I did.

659
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:57,557
Bill's decison by the fireplace ended the ten year 
IBM/Microsoft partnership

660
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:01,280
and turned IBM into an also-ran in the PC 
business.

661
00:44:01,346 --> 00:44:03,473
Did David beat Goliath?

662
00:44:04,271 --> 00:44:08,393
The Boca Raton, Florida birthplace of the IBM's PC
is deserted,

663
00:44:08,725 --> 00:44:10,852
a casualty of diminishing market share.

664
00:44:22,684 --> 00:44:25,344
Today, IBM is again what it was before:

665
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:28,202
a profitable, dominant mainframe computer 
company.

666
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:34,251
For awhile IBM dominated the PC market. 
They legitimised the PC business,

667
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:39,170
created the standards most of us now use, 
and introduced the PC

668
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:40,633
to the corporate world.

669
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:43,159
But in the end they lost out.

670
00:44:43,159 --> 00:44:45,818
Maybe it was to a faster, more flexible 
business culture.

671
00:44:47,413 --> 00:44:49,407
Or maybe they just threw it away.

672
00:44:49,806 --> 00:44:53,462
That's the view of a guy who's been competing 
with IBM for 20 years,

673
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:57,916
Silicon Valley's most outspoken software 
billionaire, Larry Ellison.

674
00:44:58,714 --> 00:45:03,034
I think IBM made the single worst mistake in 
the history of enterprise on earth.

675
00:45:03,566 --> 00:45:06,424
- Which was?
Which was the manufacture

676
00:45:06,491 --> 00:45:09,948
being the first manufacturer and distributor of 
the Microsoft/Intel PC

677
00:45:09,948 --> 00:45:12,607
which they mistakenly called the IBM PC.

678
00:45:13,072 --> 00:45:15,930
I mean they were the first manufacturer and 
distributor of that technology

679
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:20,583
I mean it's just simply astounding that they 
could ah...

680
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:23,708
basically give a third of their market value 
to Intel

681
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:27,032
and a third of their market value to Microsoft 
by accident

682
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,751
I mean no-one, no-one... I mean those two 
companies today are worth 

683
00:45:32,216 --> 00:45:35,806
close to you know approaching 
a hundred billion dollars

684
00:45:36,205 --> 00:45:38,731
I mean not many of us get a chance to make 
a $100 billion mistake.

685
00:45:39,662 --> 00:45:44,846
As fast as IBM abandons its buildings, Microsoft 
builds new ones.

686
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:49,633
In 1980 IBM was 3000 times the size of Microsoft.

687
00:45:49,898 --> 00:45:54,751
Though still a smaller company, today Wall Street 
says Microsoft is worth more.

688
00:45:54,884 --> 00:45:59,205
Both have faced anti-trust investigations about 
their monopoly positions.

689
00:45:59,604 --> 00:46:06,849
For years IBM defined successful American corporate
culture - as a machine of ordered bureaucracy.

690
00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:11,436
Here in the corridors of Microsoft it's a different 
style, it's personal.

691
00:46:12,167 --> 00:46:15,159
This company - in its drive, its hunger to succeed,

692
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:19,147
is a reflection of one man, its founder, Bill Gates.

693
00:46:19,612 --> 00:46:28,055
Bill wanted to win. 
Incredible desire to win and to beat other people.

694
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:35,832
At Microsoft we, the whole idea was that we would
put people under, you know.

695
00:46:35,832 --> 00:46:41,815
And unfortunately, ah... that's happened a lot.

696
00:46:42,147 --> 00:46:45,870
Bill Gates is special. You wouldn't have had 
a Microsoft

697
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:49,060
with take a random other person like Gary Kildall.

698
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:52,118
On the other hand, Bill Gates was also lucky.

699
00:46:52,118 --> 00:46:58,234
But Bill Gates knows that, unlike a lot of other
people in the industry, and he's paranoid.

700
00:46:58,234 --> 00:47:02,089
Every morning he gets up and he doesn't feel 
secure, he feels nervous about this. 

701
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:06,875
They're trying hard, they're not relaxing, and that's 
why they're so successful.

702
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:12,393
And I remember, I was talking to Bill once and I 
asked him what he feared,

703
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:18,774
and he said that he feared growing old because, you 
know, once you're beyond thirty,

704
00:47:18,774 --> 00:47:21,832
this was his belief at the time, you know once you're 
beyond thirty, you know,

705
00:47:21,832 --> 00:47:25,156
you don't have as many good ideas anymore. 
You're not as smart anymore.

706
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:29,011
If you just slow down a little bit who knows who 
it'll be,

707
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:32,668
probably some company that may not even 
exist yet,

708
00:47:32,734 --> 00:47:35,991
but eh someone else can come in and take the lead.

709
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,581
And I said well, you know, you're going to age, it's 
going to happen, it's kind of inevitable,

710
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,910
what are you going to do about it?

711
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:45,165
And he said I'm just going to hire the smartest 
people and I'm going to surround myself

712
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:46,627
with all these smart people, you know.

713
00:47:46,627 --> 00:47:49,951
And I thought that was kind of interesting. 
It was almost - it was like he was like oh,

714
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:54,870
I can't be immortal, but like maybe this is the 
second best and I can buy that, you know.

715
00:47:56,864 --> 00:48:02,248
If you miss what's happening then the same kind of 
thing that happened to IBM

716
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,838
or many other companies could happen to 
Microsoft very easily.

717
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:10,691
So no-one's got a guaranteed position in the high 
technology business, and the more you think about,

718
00:48:10,691 --> 00:48:13,416
you know, how could we move faster, what could 
we do better,

719
00:48:13,416 --> 00:48:19,066
are there good ideas out there that we should be 
going beyond, it's important.

720
00:48:19,332 --> 00:48:25,248
And I wouldn't trade places with anyone, but the 
reason I like my job so much is

721
00:48:25,248 --> 00:48:29,104
that we have to constantly stay on top of 
those things.

722
00:48:30,433 --> 00:48:35,552
The Windows software system that ended the alliance
between Microsoft and IBM

723
00:48:35,552 --> 00:48:38,211
pushed Gates past all his rivals.

724
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:43,462
Microsoft had been working on the software for 
years, but it wasn't until 1990 that they finally

725
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:48,115
came up with a version that not only worked 
properly, it blew their rivals away,

726
00:48:48,248 --> 00:48:51,306
and where did the idea for this software come from?

727
00:48:51,306 --> 00:48:53,633
Well not from Microsoft, of course.

728
00:48:57,222 --> 00:48:59,416
It came from the hippies at Apple.

729
00:48:59,682 --> 00:49:05,399
Lights! Camera! Boot up! In 1984, they made a 
famous TV commercial.

730
00:49:05,665 --> 00:49:10,650
Apple had set out to create the first user-friendly
PC just as IBM and Microsoft

731
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,043
were starting to make a machine for businesses.

732
00:49:13,176 --> 00:49:16,766
When the TV commercial aired, Apple launched 
the Macintosh.

733
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:25,009
The computer and the commercial were aimed 
directly at IBM

734
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:28,199
which the kids in Cupertino thought of as 
Big Brother.

735
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,526
But Apple had targeted the wrong people.

736
00:49:30,725 --> 00:49:35,844
It wasn't Big Brother they should have been worrying 
about, it was big Bill Gates.
